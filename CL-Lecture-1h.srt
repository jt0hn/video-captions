1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
In this video, we're
going to look at how to

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,050
code up our simple
universe in Haskell.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,875
This is the universe we had with

4
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:16,484
nine triangles and
desks, various colors.

5
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,705
And we made statements
about them.

6
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:21,015
So we've discussed that
what we're going to do

7
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:24,135
now is to code it in Haskell.

8
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:25,980
So we can write queries in

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,905
Haskell corresponding
to those statements.

10
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:31,140
The first thing we
have to do is to look

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,555
at describing the universe.

12
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:37,535
In Haskell, everything
has a type.

13
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:40,850
We don't want to
describe the universe by

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,360
coding it up with integers
or something like that.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,840
We want to just talk about
the things in the universe.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,110
So what we're going
to do is to introduce

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,230
their names as elements

18
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,785
of a special type that we
create out of nowhere.

19
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:01,415
Then we'll describe
their properties

20
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:05,360
by defining functions in Haskell.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,780
So the first thing we
have to do is to create

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,270
a type with nine things
whose names are RST U,

23
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,250
V, W, X, Y, Z.

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,190
That's done very
simply in Haskell,

25
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,680
we simply make a
data declaration.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,360
This is just about the simplest

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,400
data declaration we can make.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,440
We say a thing is either R or S,

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,075
or T, or U,

30
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:37,810
or V, or W, or X, or Y or Z.

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,395
What that does, that declaration

32
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:45,639
creates a type called thing.

33
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,550
And there are nine values of

34
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,400
type thing and their
names are RST U,

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,990
V, W, X, Y, Z.

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,540
We can take things and
put them in a list,

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,410
for instance, as we can with
objects of any given type.

38
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,735
So we can define the
list of things to be R,

39
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:10,370
S, T, U, V, W, X,

40
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,485
Y, Z, all put analyst.

41
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:14,405
And that's a list of length

42
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:18,245
nine containing all the
things in our universe.

43
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:21,110
The first description
we're going to give of

44
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,670
the universe is going to be in

45
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,935
terms of the features
of the things,

46
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:27,860
have color, shape, and size.

47
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,210
To deal with colors,

48
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,695
shapes and sizes will
introduce three more types.

49
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,645
A type color, type,

50
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:38,315
shape, and a type size.

51
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:39,680
Again, we'll use one of

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,350
these enumerated type definitions

53
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,940
for each of these types.

54
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,520
So we're just creating in

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,405
Haskell types for the things
you want to talk about.

56
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:53,060
We talk about these three colors.

57
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,590
We could add more if we wanted to

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,740
have a bigger palette of colors,

59
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,440
we talk about these two shapes.

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,970
Again, we could have more.

61
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,265
And we talk about these
two sizes, big and small.

62
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:14,630
The features will be functions
from things to colors,

63
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,310
from things to shape,
things to size.

64
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,380
We're going to define

65
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,750
a function color such
that the color of t,

66
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,555
for instance, is blue.

67
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:33,425
While the color of u will be red.

68
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:36,570
We can do this simply in Haskell.

69
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,235
We say data color is
red or blue or green.

70
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:48,860
We're defining a function
colour of type, thing to color.

71
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,605
And we just look,

72
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,125
color of R is green.

73
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,550
So we write that down.

74
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,665
Color of S is green,

75
00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:01,160
colour of T is blue, and so on.

76
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,320
We just list or
enumerate these clauses.

77
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,960
And that creates a color in

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,545
Haskell that gives everything
the correct color.

79
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:15,090
If we've defined it correctly.

80
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,845
We could give similar definitions

81
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:25,195
for shape and size for
each of the objects.

82
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:30,940
So we'd have then our
type thing or type color,

83
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,285
our type shape, type size.

84
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:36,550
We'd have features which are

85
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,120
functions from things to colors,

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,330
things to shapes,
things, thesises.

87
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,060
And if we start to describe

88
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,840
any real situation in this way,

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,070
we get an awful lot of

90
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,450
different types and we have

91
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,130
to treat them all differently.

92
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,200
So instead of doing that,

93
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,030
we're going to describe
things in the universe,

94
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,245
introducing predicates
that describe

95
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,820
the properties that they have.

96
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,095
So for instance, it is
true that T is blue.

97
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,960
It is true that zed is blue,

98
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,085
but it's false that u is blue.

99
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,540
We can describe all of

100
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,575
our features by giving
predicates instead.

101
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,270
And that's a lot more uniform.

102
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,000
We will use the same
kind of thing to

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,435
describe the predicate
of being read,

104
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:34,400
the predicate of being a disc,

105
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,635
and the predicate of being large.

106
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:38,930
So the large red disc would

107
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,690
satisfy all three of
those predicates.

108
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,749
On the other hand, it's false.

109
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:48,955
For instance, that
zed is a triangle.

110
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:54,415
It's false that r is big and
it's false that u is small.

111
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:57,700
So we'll define what
things are big,

112
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,050
what things are small.

113
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,925
Not by saying we have a function
which gives the feature,

114
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:06,130
but by saying we
have a predicate,

115
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,505
which tells us a
predicate is a function

116
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:13,540
from things in the universe
to the Boolean values.

117
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,260
And we can say that very
succinctly in Haskell,

118
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,540
we say type predicate
equals thing arrows bool.

119
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,260
Thereafter we can use predicate.

120
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,190
When we're talking
about that type,

121
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,085
bool is the boolean type.

122
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:33,440
And in fact, BU,

123
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,825
although it's introduced
in the prelude,

124
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,810
is actually defined in terms

125
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,125
of constructors false and true.

126
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,845
Once we got this
type abbreviation,

127
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:48,980
we say predicate to
mean thing arrows bool.

128
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,110
Then we can use it.

129
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,350
As before, we declare

130
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,405
the data type thing as
an enumerated type.

131
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:02,300
We have the data type of things.

132
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,700
We have a list of all things.

133
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,310
We're going to
define a predicate.

134
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,305
The thing arrows bow.

135
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,915
Then we're going to
define predicates.

136
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:14,375
Is red, is blue, is green,

137
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,010
is disk, is triangle,

138
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,125
is small, and is big.

139
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,525
And all of those
will be predicates.

140
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:23,400
We define those predicates.

141
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,540
This is just repeated
up here and we wouldn't

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,865
repeat it to cause
in a Haskell file.

143
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,159
But it's just to remind
us that the context,

144
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,140
we have a data type thing.

145
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,125
It has all these values

146
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,660
and those are the
only values we have.

147
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,440
So in order to say whether
something's a disc,

148
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,110
we can say, well it's a disk
if it's r or u, or y or z.

149
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,270
So is disc R is true,

150
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,100
is this, U is true,

151
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,930
is this Y is true,

152
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,055
and is disk Zed is true
for anything else.

153
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:00,860
And that's what this
wildcard underscore does

154
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,070
for anything else
is disk is false.

155
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,665
So we only need to mention

156
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:09,110
these four disks and

157
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,915
then say that nothing
else is a disk.

158
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:17,015
Then we can say that
something is a triangle.

159
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:19,235
It's not a desk.

160
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:23,090
And remember, predicates
are functions.

161
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,455
So to define what
is triangle means,

162
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:31,025
we say is triangle of x.

163
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:33,380
The value of that is

164
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,880
the negation of the
value of is disk of X.

165
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,070
So we check whether it's a desk.

166
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,580
If that's true, then
it's not a triangle.

167
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,190
If that's false, then
it is a triangle.

168
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,100
These declarations show you

169
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,945
an important feature of Haskell.

170
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:53,585
And if you haven't seen the
Haskell thread already,

171
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:55,760
I'll just pointed out briefly,

172
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,060
when we introduce these
values in a data declaration,

173
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,220
we use capital letters.

174
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,325
These are things
called constructors.

175
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:09,320
They're not variables then

176
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,025
names for things in the
type we've introduced.

177
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:17,495
We can use those
constructors as patterns.

178
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:19,280
Here the pattern is very simple.

179
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,035
It just says if it's r,

180
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:24,575
do this, if it's you
do this, and so on.

181
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:28,100
We can use those as patterns
when we're defining

182
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,590
functions by saying what value

183
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,200
they have for a given variable,

184
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,250
then that variable always
starts with a lowercase.

185
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:42,920
So is triangle, X is not
the value of is disk of X.

186
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,280
This X could be any one of these.

187
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,470
Whereas in these declarations,

188
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,590
These are just stands for that.

189
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,940
We have operations in
Haskell on Booleans.

190
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,520
These operations correspond to

191
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,000
the Boolean operations
we've already talked about.

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,100
We have constants true and
false because the Boolean type

193
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,710
was introduced as
an enumerated type

194
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,575
with the value is false and true.

195
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:18,454
Then we have infix
functions and or,

196
00:10:18,454 --> 00:10:23,300
which correspond to the
logical AND logical OR.

197
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,820
And we have negation or not
which corresponds to not.

198
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,800
This not goes from bowl to BU.

199
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,030
Will also need to introduce
the negation on predicates,

200
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,770
which we'll do shortly.

201
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,500
Continuing with our example,

202
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,870
we can also define
the predicate is

203
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,935
read by saying we have
these two red things.

204
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:50,570
It's true for these,

205
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,084
it's false for these,

206
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,665
false for anything else is blue,

207
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:57,590
is true for these
three blue things.

208
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,540
And false for anything else.

209
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,090
When we come to is green,

210
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,360
we can make another function
definition to define

211
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,780
this in terms of the values
of his red and blue.

212
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,115
We can do a similar thing
with is small and is big.

213
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:18,350
We list the small things,

214
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,605
are S, v and x are small.

215
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:24,455
Anything else is not small.

216
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:27,620
Something's big.
If it's not small.

217
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,570
This is correct.

218
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,005
But no real Haskell programmer
would write it this way.

219
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:36,350
They would write not dot is

220
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,809
small.com two functions is small.

221
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,930
Function from things to Booleans.

222
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,560
Not is a function from
Booleans to booleans.

223
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,270
And when we compose them,

224
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,070
we get the effect of

225
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,695
the definition on
the previous slide.

226
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,630
But much more succinctly,

227
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,215
you'll learn to use
function composition a lot

228
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:02,450
and not introduce variables

229
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,790
like X in our
previous definition.
